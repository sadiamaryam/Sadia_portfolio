# [Project 1 : Human Resource Analysis ][https://github.com/sadiamaryam/Sadia_portfolio]
## Data Source :

We have ' Human Resource ' data set (from Kaggle:William Walter:https://www.kaggle.com/colara/human-resource).  

## Data Description :


Companies want to improve and maintain a healthy relationship and environment for their employees. This can be achieved by recognizing and understanding the important factors that are associated with employee turnover and taking care of them might add into the productivity and growth of the employees. These insights can help managers for grabing the opportunity to take corrective steps to build and preserve their successful business. 

## Project Goal :

The goal of the Project is based on understanding what factors contributed most to employee turnover and to create a model that can predict if a certain employee will leave the company or not.

## Conclusion :

3 different Learning Models ( Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Ada Boost ) were tested, and we have achieved the best Prediction Performance using Random Forest, followed by Ada Boost, then Logistic Regression.

The best Prediction Performance was achieved with a Random Forest Regressor using all features in the data set and resulted in the following metrics :

1) Accuracy : 0.989778

2) Precision : 0.992516

3) Recall : 0.965423

4) F1_score : 0.978782
